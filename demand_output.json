        "description": "MFS is seeking proposals from qualified vendors to provide four QA Automation Leads/Architects to join the Delivery Capabilities QA Automation Team.  We are seeking both Java (Selenium and RestAssured) and Python (TestComplete) specialists.\nThe Delivery Capabilities QA Automation Team's mission is to create cutting-edge QA automation solutions that enhance the efficiency, reliability, and speed of the software development lifecycle.  This includes continual improvements for scrum teams to develop, run and analyze test suites.  This includes ease of use and lowering the overall cost of automation ownership.\nCurrent Team Responsibilities:\n\tAutomation Framework Enhancements: Expand upon our Java and Python capabilities for our open-source tools and home-grown solutions.  This includes integrating new 3rd party libraries and upgrading existing libraries and methods as needs arise.\n\tSkills Development: Continuously evolve the team's expertise in AI, Java, Python, Observability, CI/CD/CT, and QA automation tools.\n\tTool Selection: Regularly assess and integrate the most effective open-source tools, libraries, and commercial QA tools.  This includes evaluating the latest AI solutions available.\n\tContinuous Improvement: Seek feedback and implement iterative improvements to our automation strategies and processes.  This includes our Automated QA Sign Off process and execution, maintenance, and time to analyze.\n\tKeep the Lights On:  Develop and maintain shared code for teams, manage the QA Jenkins platform including individual server configuration, capabilities, and upgrades.  Empower less experienced automation professionals.\n\nScope of Work:\nIn addition to the above responsibilities the QA Automation Leads/Architect will embrace an internal consulting role, working closely with scrum teams to evaluate, make suggestions, and assist in the implementation of those suggestions.  Responsibilities include:\n\tWork with each portfolio team to understand their needs. Make sure teams are taking advantage of automation capabilities that exist, and work with teams to optimize the script development, maintenance, and analysis efforts.\n\tDrill down and take a critical look at how the team is coding.  This will include making sure teams are actively following coding standards.  This might mean that we take over pull request reviews in Bitbucket for a period.  As an example. hard-coded XPath locators in Selenium have snuck in the code over the past year+ and we want to coach and prevent those things from happening.\n\tDevelop a suite of Grafana templates and gadgets that teams can choose from to customize their Observability experience.\n\tLeverage AI best practices to expedite test script creation when given a Jira Story (i.e. set of requirements). Leverage AI best practices to expedite test script creation when given a manual test case. This will be for both Java and Python tools.  Create a data storage of test script errors and use AI to categorize failures, give feedback to teams on root cause analysis, and how to fix when possible.\n\tFollowing the initial consultation, the primary responsibilities will include designing, developing, executing, analyzing results, and reporting on automation scripts, as well as continually enhancing the processes. This may consist of managing an automation project from its inception through the design phase, development, and finally, transitioning the completed artifacts to the relevant teams.\n",
